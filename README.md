## Focus

### AISP â€” AI Symbolic Protocol  
Structured language for reasoning, memory graphs, and multi-agent coordination.  
Supports clear goals, traceable steps, and consistent agent workflows.

### Agentic Engineering  
Designing modular agents with planning, reflection, and tool use.  
Delivers MVPs rapidly with FastAPI, Supabase, and React
Direct of the Agentics Foundation

### Course Creation & Instructing  
Graduate-level courses and workshops, including *Pair Programming with AI*  
and *AI for Business*. Harvard CS50 Teaching Fellow.

### Consulting  
Fractional AI architect for startups and growth teams.  
Focus on roadmaps, audits, and rapid MVP delivery.

### AGI Research  
Exploring neuro-symbolic methods, reflective loops, dynamic memory graphs,  
and frameworks for emergent intelligence.

## Current SOTA

### 1. Install Claude Code Globally
```bash
# Recommended: Codespaces (avoid local unless with guardrails)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
````

### 2. Supporting Tools

* [**claude-flow**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-flow)
  Initialize with `npx claude-flow@alpha init --force` (by RuvNet).
  *Scaffold repeatable Claude Code workflows with built-in agent orchestration.*

* [**swarm-setup**](https://github.com/bar181/swarm-setup)
  Custom agent swarms and workflows for advanced coordination.
  *Demonstrates multi-agent orchestration with modular, reusable task flows.*

### 3. Simple Comparison Test

* [**indiana-meetup**](https://github.com/bar181/indiana-meetup)
  Example repo showing **SOTA vs OpenAI** approaches for Agentic Foundation startups.
  *Compares GPTâ€‘4o and Claude Opus on a reproducible singleâ€‘file webpage challenge.*
