## Focus

### AISP â€” AI Symbolic Protocol  
Structured language for reasoning, memory graphs, and multi-agent coordination.  
Supports clear goals, traceable steps, and consistent agent workflows.

### Agentic Engineering  
Designing modular agents with planning, reflection, and tool use.  
Delivers MVPs rapidly with FastAPI, Supabase, and React
Direct of the Agentics Foundation

### Course Creation & Instructing  
Graduate-level courses and workshops, including *Pair Programming with AI*  
and *AI for Business*. Harvard CS50 Teaching Fellow.

### Consulting  
Fractional AI architect for startups and growth teams.  
Focus on roadmaps, audits, and rapid MVP delivery.

### Harvard Capstone - AI First Documentation 
Leveraging neuro-symbolic methods, reflective loops, dynamic memory graphs,  
and frameworks for agentic processes to create comprehensive documentation 
with <5% ambiguity and <2% functional loss (compared to tested human written 
documentation that includes 4--65% ambiguity.  Goal is to quantify ability to 
use agentic processes and neural symbolic languages for SOTA documentation workflows.

## Current SOTA

### 1. Install Claude Code Globally
```bash
# Recommended: Codespaces (avoid local unless with guardrails)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
````

### 2. Supporting Tools

* [**AI Toolkit **](https://github.com/bar181/agentic-lab-ai)
  Example of course work deliverables for students for Practical AI 

* [**swarm-setup**](https://github.com/bar181/swarm-setup)
  Custom agent swarms and workflows for advanced coordination.
  *Demonstrates multi-agent orchestration with modular, reusable task flows.*
