Course / Workshop Design  • Instructor  • Harvard Master Student + CS50 TF/CA  
AI Architect • Agentic Engineering • AISP Neural Symbolic Languages  • Agentic Sysstem Researcher

I design advanced agentic systems, build symbolic reasoning frameworks, and teach the future of human-AI collaboration. My work blends academic research with hands-on engineering to create adaptive, explainable, and production-ready AI workflows. I study at **Harvard Extension School (Digital Media Design, ALM)** and instruct across graduate programs and private institutions.

# 🔬 Education & Research — Practical AI

I specialize in turning complex machine intelligence concepts into practical tools for developers, founders, and teams. My teaching emphasizes **smart intern workflows**, **persona-driven insights**, **prompt-refine loops**, and **mixture-of-experts reasoning**, giving learners clarity while building real, usable prototypes.

Students create **pitch decks, data stories, visualizations, and no-code webapps**, using structured reasoning and agentic design to upskill rapidly. Clients include **Agentic Learning Labs, Bradley.Academy, and private universities**, where I deliver modern AI literacy and hands-on product development experiences.

# 🧠 Agentic Engineering

I develop modular, adaptive agents powered by symbolic reasoning, AISP, databases, and deterministic templates. These systems reduce ambiguity, accelerate build speed, and support explainable decision loops for production scenarios. Repos include both public tools and advanced private agents for invite-only collaborators.

# 🎓 Course Design — Agentic Professor

I create robust instructional design systems for technical education, blending Harvard- and Stanford-style teaching models with modern agentic automation. Lessons follow a structured learning arc with clear objectives, consistent voice, and adaptive pacing.

My **Agentic Professor** agents generate entire courses with tone-tuned lessons:

1. engaging introductions,
2. clear explanations,
3. real-world applications with case studies,
4. activity-driven “show, don’t tell” walkthroughs.

# 📚 Agentic Course Design System

(*Bradley.Academy — Core Repo*)

This system coordinates specialized agents to build end-to-end courses, from learning objectives to assessments. It separates universal knowledge from role-specific applications, allowing content to scale from beginner to master’s level. Adaptive learning ensures consistency with teaching styles I value and model in my own classrooms.

The module architecture automates lesson creation with Bloom-aligned progression and tailored problem sets across experience levels. This is the central workflow I use for workshops, graduate courses, and professional programs.
